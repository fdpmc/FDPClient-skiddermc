## Setting up a Workspace
FDPClient uses gradle, so make sure that it is installed properly. Instructions can be found on [Gradle's website](https://gradle.org/install/).
1. Clone the repository using `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/SkidderMC/FDPClient.git` (Make sure you have git or Github Desktop installed on your system).
2. CD into the local repository folder.
3. Depending on which IDE you are using, execute either of the following commands:
    - For IntelliJ: `gradlew --debug setupDevWorkspace idea genIntellijRuns build`
    - For Eclipse: `gradlew --debug setupDevWorkspace eclipse build`
4. Open the folder as a Gradle project in your IDE.
5. Select the Forge run configuration.

## Additional libraries
### Mixins
Mixins can be used to modify classes at runtime before they are loaded. FDPClient uses them to inject its code into the Minecraft client. This way, we do not have to ship Mojang's copyrighted code. If you want to learn more about it, check out their [documentation](https://docs.spongepowered.org/5.1.0/en/plugin/internals/mixins.html).

## Contributing
We welcome contributions, but you have to follow the following rules in order for us to merge your pull request.

### Language and Code Quality
Your code needs to be able to build, please ensure your code has little to no bugs!  
You also need to use kotlin features to make coding easier and faster, so please use kotlin and pass the [Detekt](https://github.com/detekt/detekt) code quality check, use kotlin features if you can, because we will never merge terrible code.

#### Kotlin features
Help enhance the code readability by using kotlin features.

Using kotlin features:
~~~kotlin
Timer().schedule(2000L) { 
    // your code
}
~~~
Not using kotlin features:
~~~kotlin
Timer().schedule(object : TimerTask() {
    override fun run() {
        // your code
    }
}, 2000L)
~~~

### Skidding
Please use original code if you can and do not directly steal code,however we welcome skidding with a packet logger or anything similar in order to skid from a closed source client and make the cheating community more open!

### Useless features
Useless features are features only you think are useful and or features can be added with a config change.  
Like the "TimerSpeed" option to InfiniteAura, this feature can be added by binding Timer to the key with InfiniteAura, or use the macro system in FDP Client.
